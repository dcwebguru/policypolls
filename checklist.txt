CLARIFICATION CHECKLIST:
1. clarify if issues are predefined

IMPLEMENTATIONN CHECKLIST:
1. Turned of TS "noImplicitAny" - will incrementally adopt TS fully as we move.
2. Use a logging library like Morgan or winston to handle log errors.
3. Schedule Backups to atlas cluster
4. Implement JWT auth. - done 
5. incrementally add Oauth.
6. comeback and rectify type casting from dotenv to other types
7. enable snyk security 
8. Come back and move all the controller into groups like auth, policy. Currently this are unccessary abstractions, most of this stuff is not
expected to grow in complexity so no need for over engineering. everthing is modular, if things get complex in future, then we seperate. 


PROPOSED FEATURES:
1. Users should be able to see who is doing what on their list of issues. 
2. If the issues are not predefined are is no easy way of validating the input, consider building a seperate NLP flask service to power
    the issues validation.
